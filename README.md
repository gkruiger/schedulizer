A small program that helped me find a schedule for 10 teams, that was limited by the following rules:
- Each team plays each round exactly once, against one other team
- Each team plays each game only once
- Each team plays each opponent only once

More background and how this program came to be in my blog: https://www.ontdeksels.nl/ontdeksel-14-de-pijlenrace-naar-de-grens/ (Dutch).
